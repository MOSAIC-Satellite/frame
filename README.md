# Satellite Frame

This is the repository for MOSAIC's 3D printed satellite frame.

For detailed information on the frame, check out its core documentation [here](https://www.mosaicsat.org/core_documentation/hardware/frame/).

To get your own MOSAIC frame, visit the MOSAIC fabrication guide [here](https://www.mosaicsat.org/getting_mosaic/).

## Planned Changes

The following are the current plans for changes to MOSAIC's frame. 

- Satellites often have sensors adhered to the exterior or interior of their frame, which point outside of the satellite (like a camera, for example). Future iterations of MOSAIC's frame will include mounting points to easily add these sensors, which can be connected to the ProtoBoard using a Qwiic cable. 
- Future versions of MOSAIC's frame may explore other methods of securing the satellite's internal boards that don't require the side brackets. 

## Change Log

You can find the change log for the Power Board on MOSAIC's website [here](https://www.mosaicsat.org/core_documentation/hardware/frame/change_log/).
